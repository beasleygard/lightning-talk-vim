# Why learn Vim?
+ When you don't have access to a GUI (e.g. ssh'ing into a remote server) or it's inconvenient to leave the command line.
+ Quickly edit one file without needing to wait for a fully featured IDE to open and analyze the entire containing directory/project
+ Vim bindings are so popular that [tons of programs](https://github.com/erikw/vim-keybindings-everywhere-the-ultimate-list) add Vim modes for more efficient use

# Why use Vim instead of VS Code?
### **Don't!**
+ Only use Vim if it makes the specific task you're doing more convenient. Vim can be effective as a lightweight support for a fully-featured IDE.
+ You can also [integrate Vim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) ([or NeoVim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asvetliakov.vscode-neovim)) into VS Code as an editor mode!
